# 1
For your selected competition, write a few sentences describing the competition problem as you interpreted it.  You want your writeup to be self-contained so your peer-reviewer does not need to go to Kaggle to study the competition description.  Clarity is more important than detail.  What's the overall goal?  What does the data look like?  How will the answers be evaluated?

Example: "The task is to predict whether a given passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic based on various attributes including age, location of the passenger's cabin on the ship, family members, the fare they paid, and other information.  Solutions are evaluated by comparing the percentage of correct answers on a test dataset."

# 2
Write a few sentences describing how you approached the problem.  What techniques did you use? 

Example: "I split the data by gender and handled each class separately.  For the females, I trivially classified all of them as "survived."  For the males, I trained a random forest as a classifier.  I ignored the pclass atribute that indicated the location of the passenger's cabin because I didn't think it was relevant."

# 3
Write a few sentences describing how you implemented your approach.  What languages and libraries did you use? What challenges did you run into?

Example: "I partitioned the data by gender manually using Excel.  I used Weka to build the random forest."

# 4
Write a few sentences assessing your approach.  Did it work?  What do you think the problems were?

Example: "My approach did not work so well, achieving a score of 0.65.  This is less than the sample solution.  I suspect I should not have ignored the pclass attribute."

# 5
Write a few sentences describing how you improved on your solution, and whether or not it worked.

Example: "I included the pclass attribute and ignored the ticket number attribute.  However, my score was actually lower the second time!"
